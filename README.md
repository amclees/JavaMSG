JavaMSG
=======

Simple Java Messenger. Mostly written to give me a basic idea of how to use the Java networking libraries.

Distributions
<br>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jormzvd1zh9u4aq/JavaMSG.zip?dl=1">Full Package</a> contains source and all binaries.
<br>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lt21p26f8hz6btv/client.jar?dl=1">Client.jar</a> for those who simply want to connect to a server.
<br>
Note that JavaMSG lacks most features attributed to a chat program. It also cannot handle large amounts of users since it creates one thread per client.

JavaMSG
=======

Simple Java Messenger. Simple client/server and user login system eventually. May add AES.

Distributions
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jormzvd1zh9u4aq/JavaMSG.zip?dl=1">Full Package</a> contains source and all binaries.
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lt21p26f8hz6btv/client.jar?dl=1">Client.jar</a> for those who simple want to connect to a server.

Note that this program is not extremely well written, and lacks most features attributed to a chat program.

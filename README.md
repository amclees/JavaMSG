JavaMSG
=======

Simple Java Messenger. Simple client/server and user login system eventually. Uses a basic implementation of the one-time pad to encrypt messages. Understand that this does NOT mean JavaMSG is secure; by the nature of the user entering a key that is converted to bytes from a string, this program is insecure. There are also probably many side-channel attacks possible. I am going to begin on the login system soon.

Note that this program is not extremely well written, and lacks most features attributed to a chat program.
